    <p class="game-description">A Mobile/PC arcade game that is being developed by myself and an artist. I am responsible for the concept, design, and programming. The hook of the game is "swinging a lightsabers to fight cool monsters". The prototype was tested and iterated many times and is now intuitive to play because of the dynamic and smooth controls that I implemented and polished. Initially you had to double tap to attack and there was no lightsaber element. During testing, players were tryng to hit the enemies without double tapping. This was a very easy choice to pivot to a more straightforward control scheme and the lightsaber idea came from that.</p>
