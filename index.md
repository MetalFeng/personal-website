                A laser sword swinging arcade game that is being developed by myself and an artist. The hook of the game is "swing laser swords to fight cool monsters". Initially, you had to double tap to attack and there was no lightsaber element. During testing, players were trying to hit enemies without double tapping. I quickly decided to pivot to a more straightforward control scheme and the laser sword idea came from that.

                A Free-form Space Shooter game with intuitive flight controls and combat. The game was developed to expand the space shooter genre on mobile. The goals for the project were dynamic and intuitive controls, open levels, interesting enemy behaviour, and customizable ship. All game assets were created by myself aside from some muzzle flashes for player weapon, SFX and Music. Through prototyping and testing multiple control schemes, I learned the importance of testing game mechanics/features early and building for your target audience. During tests, men on average preferred faster and more sensitive controls while women preferred slower and more focused controls.

                A treasure hunting adventure game I made with a team for the Global Game Jam 2021. The theme for the jam was "lost and found", so I went with a treasure hunting theme for hook of the game. There are traps with different behavious that test player reflexes and short term decision making skills. I was very happy with the feel of movement in the game with very strong visual feedback.

                A horror FPS game demo that I made during my time in university. I programmed first person controls following online tutorials. A fully functional handgun with optimized raycast hit detection, recoil, animations, VFX, and SFX was built using static assets from asset stores and online repositories. The enemy AI in the game was implemented with a simple state machine, navmesh, and pathfinding. The context sensitive item UI pop-ups allowed for intuitive and quick communication with the player while maintainiing immersion. It was my first time building a Unity game from scratch and allowed me to learn the essentials of game development and the engine.
